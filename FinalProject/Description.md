## Project Proposal

#### Introduction: 
This folder is a description of my final project which includes a rough sketch of how  my work will be displayed and  a brief explantion of my approach to the hardware and software components.

In this final project , I would  like to explore people's interaction with the compression and expansion of a virtual spring. As users physically interact with my piece,  distance sensors will detect their movement (in one dimension) and translate and translate the implications of such movement on a spring drawn on processing.

#### List of things I need that is not in my kit:

- A projector
- HDMI cable
- One more distance sensor
- A stand of some kind  of chest level platfrom
- A bit of space
- A bit of darkness for the projected image to be clear. 
- A wall to project the image on.


#### Description of the Arduino Program:

The program will get serial input from two distance sensors and send the values to processing. 

#### Description of the Processing program: 

The values send by the arduino to processing will then by mapped to a reasonable range for the compression and expansion of a spring. 
The values will determine how the spring will move. the spring itslef will be inspired by this example on the Processing example page - https://processing.org/examples/spring.html

#### Things I do not know/ Areas of greatest concern:
- How to illustrate  a spring
- Right now my plan only works in teh horizontal direction. How do I make it two dimensional?
