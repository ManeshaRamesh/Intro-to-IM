#### Reading Response to Golan Levinâ€™s notes on computer Vision for Artists

I was vrey intrigued by teh various computer vision techniques listed in this article. Of course, many of them depended on certain physical conditions that 
made the output function better. The fact that LimboTime was made in an afternoon using very simplet racking techniques was very interesting.
Especially, for the pruposes of exhibits and art installations, we can define the physical conditions ourselves, so the emphasis is not on whether computer vision
algorithm is flexible. The emphasis is on whether it delivers and the interaction is intuitive. Reading this article gave me a lot of ideas for
my final project. It is a shame that I already wrote up the proposal to do something different.
