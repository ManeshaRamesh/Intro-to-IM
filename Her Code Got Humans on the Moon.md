 ### Reading Response
 The fact that, I have never heard of MARGARET HAMILTON before despite her serious contribution to the Apollo Program as well as the 
 initial conversation about the concept of software speaks to me about how male centric the technology industry was at the time of the 
 Space Race. However, I am glad this article reflects on female contribution to technology industry which is often shadowed by successful 
 equally talented male pioneers. One more thing that this article touches upon ever so slightly is accounting for human errors in human
 computer interaction. It was interesting to read that the human-centric deisgn was not accounted for in the apollo mission despite some 
 pushback from Hamilton. This reiterates the  point that technology is not made to function on its own. It is made to serve humans. 
 Therefore, interaction design that accounts for human errors  is crucial.
