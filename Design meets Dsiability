This reading made me want to rethink design in the context of disability. So far, my defintion has been along the lines of visual 
and physical accessibility. However, it seems that design assumes teh responsibility to account for emotional/mental accessibility.
It seems that the user should feel emotionally confortable with wearing something that is designed to aid their disability. 
ThiComfort can be attributed to various things. However, the article discusses discretion in particular depth. Glasses can 
be fashionable despite showcasing the disability of poor vision. However, hearing aids are better received when they are 
small and discrete. In the case of Aimee Mullins, her prosthetic limbs are part of her fashion choices every day.Her take 
on her disability allows for more designs that do not conceal but brag. It is hard to take a stance in this matter of whether 
designs should highight or conceal disabilities. However, I do think that design is different from art as in it is more humble. It
exists to serve and hence it should serve the needs of the user in terms of comfort. It does not exist to make a statement.
